# symd

Script authored by Jan Medved and augmented by Einar Nilsen-Nygaard to generate a variety of yang module dependency graphs and output suitable for visualization with D3.js tools.

Some C-library dependencies must be installed to enable matplotlib, which is integrated as part of the functionality provided by symd:

* freetype

These may be installed via your packaging mechanism of choice, e.g. macports or brew on MacOS, yum or apt on linux.
